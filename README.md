# WinePhysicochemicalProperties
Physicochemical properties and quality ratings for wines pulled from UCI dataset. 

This project we:
Load the wine quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Explored the data by displaying basic information and statistics.
Visualized feature correlations using a heatmap.
Added a new categorical target column 'quality_label' based on the numeric 'quality' column.
Selected features and target variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Scaled the feature values using StandardScaler.
Trains a random forest classifier.
Makes predictions using the test set and evaluates the model using classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score.
