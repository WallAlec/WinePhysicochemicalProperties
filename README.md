# WinePhysicochemicalProperties
physicochemical properties and quality ratings for wines pulled from UCI dataset. 

This project will:
Load the wine quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Explores the data by displaying basic information and statistics.
Visualizes feature correlations using a heatmap.
Adds a new categorical target column 'quality_label' based on the numeric 'quality' column.
Selects features and target variables.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Scales the feature values using StandardScaler.
Trains a random forest classifier.
Makes predictions using the test set and evaluates the model using classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score.
